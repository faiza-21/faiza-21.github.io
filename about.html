    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hi! I’m Faiza, the creator of this website. Homelessness is an issue I see around me all the time. Every day on my way to and from school, I see many homeless people on the train and on the streets. It’s frustrating to me that even if I were to help everyone I saw, the overall impact would be miniscule. I believe that absolutely everyone deserves food and a roof over their head. The fact that so many people of all different races, ages, genders, and more all suffer from the lack of a shelter, money, or food is devastating. This is why I wanted to create a website designed to draw attention to this global issue. Hopefully, being on this website has taught you something new or inspired you to take a stand. </p>
