    <h1>Homelessness & Poverty</h1>
    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
    <p>Homelessness and poverty are some of the biggest problems in our world. Millions of people do not have adequate living conditions. While homelessness and poverty are global issues, it’s frustrating that it is such a big problem in a first-world country like America where we have the resources to make a change.  Homelessness and poverty affect a very large portion of our country’s population. There are various reasons behind this, but a few of the biggest challenges are lack of affordable housing, underpayment, unemployment, lack of healthcare, mental illness, domestic violence, and addiction. When an individual falls into poverty, they must make the choice to spend the little they have on food, healthcare, education, shelter, or others. A lot of the time shelter is the first sacrifice that is made and people are left homeless.</p>
    <h2>Who It Impacts:</h2>
    <p>•Unemployed people</p>
    <p>•Immigrants from developing countries</p>
    <p>•Single-parent families</p>
    <h2>Types of Homelessness:</h2>
    <p>•Chronic homelessness- People who are likely to be homeless for a long period of time; these people may be older, completely unemployed, and may suffer from disabilities or substance abuse.</p>
    <p>•Transitional homelessness- People who have been forced into homelessness due to certain circumstances but eventually make a transition into more stable housing.</p>
    <p>•Episodic homelessness- People who shuffle in and out of homeless shelters; these people tend to be young, chronically unemployed, and they may suffer from medical, mental, or substance-related issues.</p>
    <h2>Misconceptions:</h2>
    <p>Many people believe that the majority of homeless people come from one specific racial background, age group, or area but that is not the case. Homeless people come from all different backgrounds, ages, races, genders, and more. We cannot group all homeless people together. The idea that homeless people are all old men with shaggy clothes and beards is false. Not all homeless individuals look a certain way; they can look like anything.</p>
    <p>Another common misconception is that homeless people do not work hard enough and their situation is their own fault. This is not always true. When an individual falls into poverty, they’re isolated from society and it’s harder for them to get good jobs. When poverty turns into homelessness, it becomes even harder to get a good job when employers refuse to give them a chance. The same logic can be applied to education and schooling. It’s not easy for homeless people to just get a job/degree and fix their lives because they are deprived of opportunities.</p>
    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
    <p>It may seem impossible to fix a problem as large as this, but there are actions we can take to improve homelessless and poverty in this country. For example: increasing employment rates or creating more jobs, establishing paid familial/sick leaves, improving the treatment of immigrants and people of color in society (no segregation), and the establishment and strengthening of social programs such as unemployment insurance, food stamps, cash assistance, and more.</p>
    <h2>Main Takeaway:</h2>
    <p>Homelessness and poverty are major issues in America but we can change that by fighting for basic human needs.</p>
